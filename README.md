# Vanlife Blogging Platform

This project is a website or application designed for vanlife enthusiasts. It creates a space for individuals passionate about vanlife to share their van-building knowledge, travel stories, tips, and experiences with a like-minded community. Users can initiate joureys inviting others, and/or create content related to the vanlife culture.

## Prerequisites
Please ensure your Python version is upgraded. For compatibility, although I used Django 5.0.6, my requirements will install 4.2.13 which supports older Python versions. The following steps will guide you through setting up the project with a virtual environment.

## Installation

1. After cloning the repo, please create a virtual environment in the directory containing `requirements.txt`:
    - On Windows:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Navigate to vanlife_blog directory (where manage.py is) to apply the migrations and start the server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

5.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to view the project.

### Running Tests

6. To run the tests, use the following command:
    ```bash
    pytest --ds=vanlife_blog.settings --cache-clear
